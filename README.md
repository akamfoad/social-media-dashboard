# Social Media Dashboard with theme switcher

This is my solution to the [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H "social media dashboard with theme switcher - frontendmentor.io") challenge, it was a junior challenge, simple and a nice design to practice on CSS. I made it with [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react/) and vanilla **CSS3**.
